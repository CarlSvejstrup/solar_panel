# README for Solpanel 04 Project (01002 Matematik 1b)

## Overview
This project, developed by students at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, explores the efficiency and optimization of solar panels, delving into the mathematical, physical, and technological aspects of solar energy conversion. The project aligns with the broader goal of enhancing the use of solar energy as a sustainable and effective energy source.

## Key Concepts
- **Solar Cell Technology**: Introduction to the evolution and technology behind solar cells, focusing on silicon-based cells with over 20% efficiency.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Usage of flux integrals to quantify energy received by the solar panels under Standard Test Conditions (STC).

## Computational Tools and Scripts
- **Numpy Analysis**: Scripts for calculating the zeros of functions using the bisection method (`script_numpy.py`).
- **Solar Position Modeling**: Various Python scripts (`koordinatsystem.py`, `solarposition_models.py`, `Solhverv.py`, and others) to calculate the optimal position and efficiency of solar panels based on the sun's position.
- **Energy Calculation**: Techniques for calculating daily and annual energy output from solar panels, considering optimal angles and positioning.

## Practical Applications
- **Optimization**: Analysis of the best installation angles and positions for maximizing solar panel efficiency in Danish households.
- **Energy Output Modeling**: Year-round simulation to determine the daily and annual energy production, considering changes in sun elevation and panel orientation.

## Extensions
- **Curved Surface Analysis**: Exploration of whether using a curved surface (quarter-sphere) increases the energy collection efficiency compared to a flat panel.
- **Economic Impact**: Consideration of energy prices and consumption patterns to determine the most cost-effective solar panel orientations.
